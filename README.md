SQL Files included to seed some data into local machine database. The created_date field for transactions doesn't fill in when a transaction is added manually without the use of UI and such, but otherwise should be fine. Make sure to add users first, then
budget, then tag, before adding any transactions, or else MySQL will yell at you. There should be a way to add these files automatically upon running the application, but that hasn't been set up yet, so you'll have to add them manually in MySQL itself.
